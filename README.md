[Myau Client](https://myau.sell.app/),  OpenMyau But Better. 


Open Myau Plus is an enhanced version of the original OpenMyau client, built with additional features, optimizations, and quality-of-life improvements. This project focuses on expanding the core functionality while maintaining stability and performance.

# Features & Improvements

- Various bug fixes and performance improvements
- Enhanced overall user experience compared to the base version

---

# About

This project is based on OpenMyau, with the goal of refining and extending its capabilities beyond the original implementation.

#  Issues & Suggestions

If you encounter any bugs or have ideas for new features, feel free to open an issue:

# Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamNespola/OpenMyau-Plus.git
cd OpenMyau-Plus
./gradlew build
```

This produces a single `build/libs/Myau+.jar` containing **both** the client and its
scripting support.

---

# Open in VS Code

- Install a JDK 8 distribution (the project uses Java toolchain 8).
- Open the cloned folder in VS Code and accept extension recommendations.
- On first open, let the Java/Gradle import finish.
- Run **Tasks: Run Task** → **Gradle: build** to build from the wrapper.
- For debugging, start **Gradle: runClient (debug)** (task) and use **Java: Attach to runClient (--debug-jvm)** from Run and Debug.

# Scripting (Raven Script Loader)

Script support comes from [`rsl/`](rsl/), a vendored copy of
[Raven Script Loader](https://codeberg.org/monster-energy/raven-script-loader). It is
bundled into the client jar rather than shipped separately: the root build compiles
`rsl/src/main/java` and `rsl/src/main/resources` as extra source directories, so one jar
registers **two Forge mods** — `myau` and `rsl` — under the mixin configs
`mixins.myau.json,mixins.rsl.json`.

RSL's own `build.gradle.kts` and wrapper are **not used** (they need a Java 21+ JVM). Keeping
it in the root build means one compile and one remap pass, with both mixin configs sharing a
single generated refmap. Install just the one jar.

Scripts drive the client through the `myau.*` API, which has no compile-time link to the
client — it issues chat commands (`.t <module>`, `.<module> <property> <value>`) that Myau+
intercepts on the outgoing chat packet, and reads back the replies while suppressing them
from the chat GUI. That bridge depends on Myau+'s command output format, so changes to
command replies can break scripts.

See [`rsl/UPSTREAM.md`](rsl/UPSTREAM.md) for provenance, the local patches applied on top of
upstream, and how to pull updates.
